# JasperFx

Foundational elements of the "Critter Stack", including:

* The inevitable grab bag of extension method utilities shared throughout the Critter Stack
* The command line parsing and command discovery (was Oakton)
* The runtime code generation (was JasperFx.CodeGeneration)
* The shared event store abstractions and projection support for Marten and future Event Sourcing Critters
